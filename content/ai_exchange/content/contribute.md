## What to Avoid

We value every contribution to our project, but it's important to be aware of certain guidelines:

- **Avoid Advertising**: The OWASP AI projects should not be a medium for promoting commercial tools, companies, or individuals. The focus should be on free and open-source tools when discussing the implementation of techniques or tests. While commercial tools generally aren't included, they may be mentioned in specific, relevant instances.
- **Refrain from Unnecessary Self-Promotion**: If you're referencing tools or articles you're affiliated with, please disclose this relationship in your pull request. This transparency helps us ensure that the content aligns with the overall objectives of the guide.

If you're unsure about anything, feel free to [reach out to us](/contact) with your questions.
