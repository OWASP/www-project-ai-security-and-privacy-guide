Artificial Intelligence (AI) is on the rise and so are the concerns regarding AI security and privacy. This project is to provide clear and actionable insights on designing, creating, testing, and procuring secure and privacy-preserving AI systems.

## Purpose

The OWASP AI Exchange is as an open source collaborative project to advance the development of global AI security standards and regulations. It provides a comprehensive overview of AI threats, vulnerabilities, and controls to foster alignment among different standardization initiatives. This includes the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 27090 (AI security), the [OWASP ML top 10](https://mltop10.info/), the [OWASP LLM top 10](https://llmtop10.com/), and [OpenCRE](https://opencre.org) - which we want to use to provide the AI Exchange content through the security chatbot [OpenCRE-Chat](https://opencre.org/chatbot).

Our **mission** is to be the authoritative source for consensus, foster alignment, and drive collaboration among initiatives - NOT to set a standard, but to drive standards. By doing so, it provides a safe, open, and independent place to find and share insights for everyone. See [AI Exchange LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/owasp-ai-exchange/).

Maintained here at [owaspai.org](https://owaspai.org) it currently uses both a GitHub repository and a Word Document for contributions. It is is an **open-source living document** for the worldwide exchange of AI security expertise. It serves, for example, as input to security standardization for the EU AI Act. The site is maintained by OWASP as part of the [OWASP AI guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/) project. It will periodically publish content with credited contributions into the Guide.
