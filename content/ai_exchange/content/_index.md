## Purpose

The OWASP AI Exchange has open sourced the global discussion on the security of AI. It is an open collaborative project to advance the development of AI security standards and regulations, by providing a comprehensive overview of AI threats, vulnerabilities and controls. This content is feeding into standards for the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 27090 (AI security), the [OWASP ML top 10](https://mltop10.info/), the [OWASP LLM top 10](https://llmtop10.com/), and [OpenCRE](https://opencre.org) - which we want to use to provide the AI Exchange content through the security chatbot [OpenCRE-Chat](https://opencre.org/chatbot).

Our **mission** is to be the authoritative source for consensus, foster alignment, and drive collaboration among initiatives - NOT to set a standard, but to drive standards. In other words: be among the top bookmarks of professionals involved in AI security. By doing so, we provide a safe, open, and independent place to find and share insights for everyone. See [AI Exchange LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/owasp-ai-exchange/).

The AI Exchange is displayed here at [owaspai.org](https://owaspai.org) and edited using a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/tree/main/content/ai_exchange/content) (see the links _Edit on Github_). It is is an **open-source living publication** for the worldwide exchange of AI security expertise, and part of the [OWASP AI security & privacy guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/) project. It is structured as one coherent resource consisting of several sections under 'content', each represented by a page on this website.
