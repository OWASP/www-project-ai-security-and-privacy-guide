## Purpose

The OWASP AI Exchange is as an open source collaborative document to advance the development of global AI security standards and regulations. It provides a comprehensive overview of AI threats, vulnerabilities, and controls to foster alignment among different standardization initiatives. This includes the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 27090 (AI security), the [OWASP ML top 10](https://mltop10.info/), the [OWASP LLM top 10](https://llmtop10.com/), and [OpenCRE](https://opencre.org) - which we want to use to provide the AI Exchange content through the security chatbot [OpenCRE-Chat](https://opencre.org/chatbot).

Our **mission** is to be the authoritative source for consensus, foster alignment, and drive collaboration among initiatives - NOT to set a standard, but to drive standards. By doing so, it provides a safe, open, and independent place to find and share insights for everyone. See [AI Exchange LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/owasp-ai-exchange/).

Maintained here at [owaspai.org](https://owaspai.org) it currently uses both a GitHub repository and a Word Document for contributions. It is is an **open-source living document** for the worldwide exchange of AI security expertise. It serves, for example, as input to security standardization for the EU AI Act towards mid-December (your help is urgently needed!). The document is maintained by OWASP as part of the [OWASP AI guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/) project. It will periodically publish content with credited contributions into the Guide.
