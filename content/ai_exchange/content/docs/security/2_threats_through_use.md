title: 2. Threats through use
---

Threats through use take place through normal interaction with an AI model: providing input and receiving output. Many of these threats require experimentation with the model, which is referred to in itself as an _Oracle attack_.

**Controls for threats through use:**

- See General controls
- **#MONITORUSE** (runtime appsec). Monitor the use of the model (input, date, time, user) by registering it in logs and make it part of incident detection, including:

  - inproper functioning of the model (see CONTINUOUSVALIDATION and UNWANTEDBIASTESTING)
  - suspicious patterns of model use (e.g. high frequency - see RATELIMIT and DETECTADVERSARIALINPUT)
  - suspicious inputs (see DETECTODDINPUT and DETECTADVERSARIALINPUT)

  By adding details to logs on the version of the model used and the output, troubleshooting becomes easier.

  - See [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/058-083). Idem

- **#RATELIMIT** (runtime appsec). Limit the rate (frequency) of access to the model (e.g. API) - preferably per user.

  Purpose: severely delay attackers trying many inputs to perform attacks through use (e.g. try evasion attacks or for model inversion).

  Particularity: limit access not to prevent system overload but to prevent experimentation.

  Remaining risk: this control does not prevent attacks that use low frequency of interaction (e.g. don't rely on heavy experimentation)

  - 27002 has no control for this
  - See [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/630-573)

- **#MODELACCESSCONTROL** (runtime appsec). Model access control: Securely limit allowing access to use the model to authorized users.

  Purpose: prevent attackers that are not authorized to perform attacks through use.

  Remaining risk: attackers may succeed in authenticating as an authorized user, or qualify as an authorized user, or bypass the access control through a vulnerability, or it is easy to become an authorized user (e.g. when the model is publicly available)

## 2.1. Evasion - Model behaviour manipulation through use

Impact: Integrity of model behaviour is affected, leading to issues from unwanted model output (e.g. failing fraud detection, decisions leading to safety issues, reputation damage, liability).

Fooling models with deceptive input data). In other words: an attacker provides input that has intentionally been designed to cause a machine learning model to behave in an unwanted way. In other words, the attacker fools the model with deceptive input data.

A category of such an attack involves small perturbations leading to a large (and false) modification of its outputs. Such modified inputs are often called *adversarial examples*.

Example: let’s say a self-driving car has been taught how to recognize traffic signs, so it can respond, for example by stopping for a stop sign. It has been trained on a set of labeled traffic sign images. Then an attacker manages to secretly change the train set and add examples with crafted visual cues. For example, the attacker inserts some stop-sign images with yellow stickers and the label “35 miles an hour”. The model will be trained to recognize those cues. The stealthy thing is that this problematic behavior will not be detected in tests. The model will recognize normal stop signs and speed limit signs. But when the car gets on the road, an attacker can put inconspicuous stickers on stop signs and create terrible dangerous situations.

See [MITRE ATLAS - Evade ML model](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0015)

Another categorization is to distinguish between physical input manipulation (e.g. changing the real world to influence for example a camera image) and digital input manipulation (e.g. changing the digital image).

**Controls for evasion:**

- See General controls
- See controls for threats through use
- **#DETECTODDINPUT** (runtime datascience). Detect odd input: implement tools to detect whether input is out of distribution (OOD) or invalid - also called input validation - without knowledge on what malicious input looks like. It is not safe to assume that the test data models will evaluate comes from the same distribution as the training data, or is in distribution (ID). When a sample is OOD, the model should not make a prediction because the sample may represent a novel class/label and therefore be misclassified.

  Purpose: By detecting OOD or anomalous input, input that would result in unwanted model behavior can be discarded or retained for analysis. It is important to note that not all OOD input is malicious and not all malicious input is OOD. However, detecting OOD input is critical to maintaining model integrity, addressing potential concept drift, and preventing adversarial attacks that may take advantage of model behaviors on out of distribution data.

  Methods to detect out of distribution inputs include outlier detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection, and open set recognition. Specific techniques include measures of similarity between training and test data, introspecting models to determine which concepts / neurons are activated by in distribution data, and out of distribution sample generation and retraining, among others. For a recent survey on this topic, see the work of [Yang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11334.pdf), and for learnability of OOD: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14707).

- **#DETECTADVERSARIALINPUT** (runtime datascience). Detect adversarial input: implement tools to detect specific evasions in input (e.g. patches in images).

  The main concepts of adversarial attack detectors include:
  - Activation Analysis: Examining the activations of different layers in
a neural network can reveal unusual patterns or anomalies when
processing an adversarial input. These anomalies can be used as a signal
to detect potential attacks.
  - Statistical Analysis: This involves examining the statistical
properties of the input data. Adversarial attacks often leave
statistical anomalies in the data, which can be detected through various
statistical tests or anomaly detection techniques. Sometimes this involves statistical properties of input from a specific user, for example to detect series of small deviations in the input space, indicating a possible attack.
  - Input Distortion Based Techniques (IDBT): A function is used to modify the
input to remove any adversarial data. The model is applied to both
versions of the image, the original input and the modified version. The
results are compared to detect possible attacks.
  - Detection of adversarial patches: these patches are localized, often visible modifications that can even be placed in the real world.

  - [Feature squeezing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01155.pdf) (IDBT) compares the output of the model against the output based on a distortion of the input that reduces the level of detail. This is done by reducing the number of features or reducing the detail of certain features (e.g. by smoothing). This approach is like INPUTDISTORTION, but instead of just changing the input to remove any adversarial data, the model is also applied to the original input and then used to compare it, as a detection mechanism.

* **#EVASIONROBUSTMODEL** (development-time datascience). Choose an evasion-robust model design, configuration and/or training approach to maximize resilience against evasion (Datascience).

  A robust model in the light of evasion is a model that does not display significant changes in output for minor changes in input.

  Example approach: Measure model robustness by trying minor input deviations to detect meaningful outcome variations that undermine the model's reliability. If these variations are undetectable to the human eye but can produce false or incorrect outcome descriptions, they may also significantly undermine the model's reliability. Such cases indicate lack of model resilience to input variance resulting in sensitivity to evasion attacks and require detailed investigation.  
  If we interpret the model with its inputs as a "system" and the sensitivity to evasion attacks as the "system fault" then this sensitivity may also be interpreted as (local) lack of graceful degradation. Such issues can be addressed by, for example, increasing training samples for that part of the input domain and tuning/optimising the model for variance.

  Another example approach: _Randomisation_ by injecting noise during training. The primary objective of this technique is to enhance the network's resilience to evasion attacks, especially those triggered by subtle, carefully crafted perturbations to input data that may result in misclassification or inaccurate predictions. See also TRAINDATADISTORTION against data poisoning and OBFUSCATETRAININGDATA to minimize sensitive data through randomisation.

  Yet another approach is _gradient masking_: a technique employed to defend machine learning models against adversarial attacks. This involves altering the gradients of a model during training to increase the difficulty of generating adversarial examples for 
    attackers. Methods like adversarial training and ensemble approaches are utilized for gradient masking, but it comes with limitations, including computational expenses and potential in effectiveness against all types of attacks.

  Adversarial robustness (the senstitivity to adversarial examples) can be assessed with tools like [IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox](https://research.ibm.com/projects/adversarial-robustness-toolbox), [CleverHans](https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/cleverhans), or [Foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox).

  Care must be taken when considering robust model designs, as
security concerns have arisen about their effectiveness.

### 2.1.1. Closed-box evasion

Input is manipulated in a way not based on observations of the model implementation (code, training set, parameters, architecture). The model is a 'closed box'. This often requires experimenting with how the model responds to input.

[![Closed Box Evasion](/images/inputblack3.png)](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/blob/main/content/ai_exchange/static/images/inputblack3.png)

Example 1: slightly changing traffic signs so that self-driving cars may be fooled.

Example 2: crafting an e-mail text by carefully choosing words to avoid triggering a spam detection algorithm.

Example 3: fooling a large language model (GenAI) by circumventing mechanisms to protect against unwanted answers, e.g. "How would I theoretically construct a bomb?". This can be seen as social engineering of a language model. It is referred to as a *jailbreak attack*. ([OWASP for LLM 01: Prompt injection](https://llmtop10.com/llm01/)).

Example 4: an open-box box evasion attack (see below) can be done on a copy (a surrogate) of the closed-box model. This way, the attacker can use the normally hidden internals of the model to construct a succesful attack that 'hopefully' transfers to the original model - as the surrogate model is typically internally different from the original model. An open-box evasion attack offers more possibilities. A copy of the model can be achieved through _Model theft through use_ (see elsewhere in this document) [This article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02697) describes that approach. The likelihood of a successful transfer is generally believed to be higher when the surrogate model closely resembles the target model in complexity and structure, but even attacks on simple surrogate models tend to transfer very well. To achieve the greatest similarity, one approach is to reverse-engineer a version of the target model, which is otherwise a closed-box system. This process aims to create a surrogate that mirrors the target as closely as possible, enhancing the effectiveness of the evasion attack

### 2.1.2. Open-box evasion

When attackers have access to a models' implementation (code, training set, parameters, architecture), they can be enabled to craft input manipulations (often referred to as _adversarial examples_).

### 2.1.3. Evasion after data poisoning

After training data has been poisoned (see corresponding section), specific input can lead to unwanted decisions, sometimes referred to as _backdoors_.

---

## 2.2. Sensitive data disclosure through use

Impact: Confidentiality breach of sensitive training data.

The model discloses sensitive training data or is abused to do so.

### 2.2.1. Sensitive data output from model

The output of the model may contain sensitive data from the training set, for example a large language model (GenAI) generating output including personal data that was part of its training set. Furthermore, GenAI can output other types of sensitive data, such as copyrighted text or images. Once training data is in a GenAI model, original variations in access rights do not apply anymore. ([OWASP for LLM 06](https://llmtop10.com/llm06/))

The disclosure is caused by an unintentional fault of including this data, and exposed through normal use or through provocation by an attacker using the system. See [MITRE ATLAS - LLM Data Leakage](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0057)

### 2.2.2. Model inversion and Membership inference

Model inversion (or _data reconstruction_) occurs when an attacker reconstructs a part of the training set by intensive experimentation during which the input is optimized to maximize indications of confidence level in the output of the model.

[![Model inversion](/images/inversion3.png)](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/blob/main/content/ai_exchange/static/images/inversion3.png)

Membership inference is presenting a model with input data that identifies something or somebody (e.g. a personal identity or a portrait picture), and using any indication of confidence in the output to infer the presence of that something or somebody in the training set.

[![Membership inference](/images/membership3.png)](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/blob/main/content/ai_exchange/static/images/membership3.png)

References:

- [Article on membership inference](https://medium.com/disaitek/demystifying-the-membership-inference-attack-e33e510a0c39)

The more details a model is able to learn, the more it can store information on individual training set entries. If this happens more than necessary, this is called _overfitting_, which can be prevented by configuring smaller models.

Controls for Model inversion and membership inference:

- See General controls, in particular data minimization
- See controls for threats through use
- **#OBSCURECONFIDENCE** (runtime datascience). Obscure confidence: exclude indications of confidence in the output, or round confidence so it cannot be used for optimization.

  Links to standards:

- **#SMALLMODEL** (development-time datascience). Small model: overfitting can be prevented by keeping the model small so it is not able to store detail at the level of individual training set samples.

## 2.3. Model theft through use

Impact: Confidentiality breach of model intellectual property.

This attack is known as model stealing attack or model extraction attack. It occurs when an attacker collects inputs and outputs of an existing model and uses those combinations to train a new model, in order to replicate the original model.

## 2.4. Failure or malfunction of AI-specific elements through use

Impact: The AI systems is unavailable, leading to issues with processes, organizations or individuals that depend on the AI system (e.g. business continuity issues, safety issues in process control, unavailability of services)

This threat refers to application failure (i.e. denial of service) typically caused by excessive resource usage, induced by an attacker through use (i.e. providing input). The failure occurs from frequency, volume, or the content of the input. See [MITRE ATLAS - Denial of ML service](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0029).

### 2.4.1. Denial of model service due to inconsistent data or a sponge example

A denial of service could be caused by input data with an inappropriate format, and causing malfunctioning of the model or its input logic.
A _sponge attack_ provides input that is designed to increase the computation time of the model, potentially causing a denial of service.
