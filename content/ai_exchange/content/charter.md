title: 'AI Exchange Charter'
---
## Purpose
>Comprehensive guidance and alignment on how to protect AI against security threats - by professionals, for professionals.

The goal of the OWASP AI Exchange is to protect society from AI security issues by independently harnessing the collective wisdom of global experts across various disciplines. This initiative focuses on advancing AI security understanding, supporting the development of global AI security guidelines, standards and regulations, and simplifying the AI security domain for professionals and organizations. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of AI threats, risks, mitigations, and controls, aligning with global standardization initiatives such as the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 27090 (AI Security), the OWASP ML Top 10, the OWASP LLM Top 10, and OpenCRE. This alignment, achieved through open source, is crucial to prevent confusion and ignorance, leading to harm from AI security incidents.

## Target Audience
This charter primarily addresses the needs of cybersecurity experts, privacy/regulatory/ legal professionals, AI leaders, developers, and data scientists. It offers accessible guidance and resources to these groups, enabling them to build and maintain secure AI systems effectively.

## Mission / Goals 
Our mission is to establish the OWASP AI Exchange as the place to go for professionals who want to understand AI security, and to be the authoritative source for consensus, alignment, and collaboration among various AI initiatives. We aim to foster a unified approach to addressing AI security challenges.

## Scope & Responsibilities
- Develop a comprehensive framework for AI threats, risks, mitigations, and controls.
- Create a map integrating AI regulatory and privacy regulations.
- Establish a common taxonomy and glossary for AI security.
- Provide guidance on testing tools with outcome assessments.
- Formulate a shared responsibility model for third-party AI model usage.
- Offer supply chain guidance and an incident response plan.

## Relation to other OWASP or other organization initiatives
These are the other OWASP AI initiatives and the relation with the AI Exchange;
- The OWASP AI security and privacy guide is the official OWASP project under which the AI Exchange was established. The deliverable of this project consists of the AI Exchange content plus guidance on AI privacy.
- The OWASP LLM top 10 provides a list of the most important LLM security issues, plus deliverables that focus on LLM security, such as the LLM AI Security & Governance Checklist.
- The OWASP ML top 10 provides a list of the most important machine learning security issues.
- OpenCRE.org has been established under the OWASP Integration standards project and holds a catalog of common requirements across various security standards inside and outside of OWASP. The plan is to let OpenCRE contain new AI security controls as well.
