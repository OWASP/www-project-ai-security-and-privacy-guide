# OWASP AI Exchange & OWASP AI security and privacy guide

Welcome to the GitHub repository for two initiatives:

1. The OWASP AI Exchange, to be found at [owaspai.org](http://owaspai.org/): the living set of documents that collect AI threats and controls from collaboration between experts worldwide.
2. The OWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide project, also to be found at [owaspai.org](http://owaspai.org/), which is published automatically at [owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/#](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/#). It holds a stable version of the AI Exchange, adds some illustrations and explanations for a wider audience, plus it has an additional section on the topic of AI privacy.

The goal of these initiatives is to collect and present the state of the art on these topics through community collaboration.
